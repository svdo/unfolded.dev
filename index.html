    <p>There's lots of cross-platform development frameworks for writing iOS and
Android apps. I don't like any of the existing ones too much. Some I
passionately don't like, some are OK-ish, but none are <em>good</em>, I feel. I'm
working on a new approach to writing cross-platform mobile apps. I want to write
a few posts about my thinking on this topic. And remember: I'm curious to learn
about your thoughts as well, so please <a href="https://github.com/svdo/unfolded.dev/issues/5">leave your comments</a> and let's
learn from each other! Important note: I'm explicitly excluding games and the
like from the scope. I'm not in that business, and in that business completely
different reasoning applies. For lack of a better term, let's say I'm talking
about "business apps".</p><h2 id="priorities">Priorities</h2><p>Choosing the right cross-platform development toolkit is all about priorities.
Are you trying to make an app for Android and iOS as fast and cheap as possible,
for example for a marketing app? Or are you going for an awesome user
experience? Do you want the iOS and Android app to be as similar as possible, or
do you want them to align the the particular OS that they are running in as much
as possible? Do you think "user experience" includes performance? Matching
users' expectations? And of course: what skills do you(r developers) have?</p><p>Let's start by laying out some of my priorities. I'll talk about both sides
of this coin: user experience and developer experience.</p><h3 id="user-experience">User Experience</h3>

    <p>In my <a href="/posts/2020-08-08-continuous-integration">previous post about continuous
integration</a> I explained that I always
quickly setup continuous integration for any project. In that post I explained
that it gives safety, allows for easier collaboration, and gives more confidence
that things keep working the way they should.</p><p>In this post I'll tell you about a nice trick that I have used
a few times to get insights from your continuous integration. There are many
third-party services that facilitate this of course, and they do so in a much
nicer way than I'll be describing here. But the thing is: you're not allowed to
use most of those for commercial purposes or private repositories. And sometimes
you just don't have the money to spend on things like this. So read on if you
want to know how you can easily gain insights with all the tools that you
already have, for free.</p><h2 id="the-end-result">The end result</h2><p>Let's start by showing an example of what we're going for. Below is a graph that
shows two code coverage measurements over time. Each data point represents a
build on the CI server. The graph is interactive and the CI server automatically
causes the graph to be updated. After you have set everything up, there are no
manual steps anymore.</p><p><img src="/img/coverage-graph.png" alt="Coverage Graph" /></p>

Potential new hobby project? <code>git init</code>. Sample code for a blog post? <code>git init</code>. Doing programming exercises on something like Exercism.io? <code>git init</code>.
And then I start using git the way I described in the <a href="/posts/2020-07-21-using-git-more-effectively">first
post</a> of this series. There are
virtually no exceptions to this; it hardly costs me anything and it has helped
me plenty of times.</p><p>The second thing that I do, I do just slightly less often, but still very often:
set up <em>continuous integration</em>. Obviously I won't do that for things that I
never push to a remote. And some things that I push to a remote don't need it
either, for example those Exercism coding exercises. But for anything that I
suspect may have a longer life than a few weeks, including <a href="https://github.com/svdo/either-validation-demo/actions">for that sample code
for a blog post</a>, I'll set it up.</p><h2 id="what-is-continuous-integration">What is continuous integration</h2>

smart scientists. Without going into details, their job was to conceive
algorithms for image processing, and improve them. They had huge volumes of
data, and the ability to create more. The algorithms had to be robust in the
face of all kinds of variations in that data. Much like software development,
their work was <a href="https://iism.org/article/why-are-ceos-failing-software-engineers-56">a creative pursuit</a>.</p><p>They would have regular meetings to discuss progress, results and challenges. In
those meetings, I remember being surprised now and then. For example, you might
hear a conversation like this<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Betty</strong>: Say, John, didn't you have some progress on «some algorithm
feature» a few weeks ago? I'm running into some issues and I think your
findings may help me here.</p><p><strong>John</strong>: Yeah, that's right, I remember having some results when I was
working on «something else». I'm not sure which algorithm variant
I used exactly though, or which test data for that matter. If it's important
to you, we can sit together and see if we can reproduce that.</p></blockquote>
