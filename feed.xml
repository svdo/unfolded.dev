I don't like any of the existing ones too much. Some I passionately don't like, some are OK-ish, but none are great, I feel.

In this post I'll go into what I mean with 'continuous integration' and the reasons why I like it: having a safety net, lowering the threshold for third-party contributions, having executable documentation, and making sure that things will keep working in the future.</description><author>Stefan</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://unfolded.dev/posts/2020-07-21-using-git-more-effectively/</guid><link>https://unfolded.dev/posts/2020-07-21-using-git-more-effectively/</link><title>Using Git as a Logbook to Improve Efficiency</title><description>Using your version control system as a logbook can help your future self, your team mates, and your successors.
