Here's a few posts that I published elsewhere, before starting this blog. This
is not an exhaustive list, just a few interesting things.

* May 2020: [Implementing Form Validation Without Conditional
  Logic](https://040code.github.io/2020/05/25/getting-help-from-your-compiler) –
  Using clever data types to reduce the possibilities for mistakes. About using
  functional programming concepts, specifically `Either`, to reduce the
  possibilities for mistakes. From that post:

  > Today I want to show you a neat technique for form validation. Almost every
  > web app will eventually have a form somewhere, and the user input of that
  > form usually needs to be validated. You can do that by writing lots of
  > conditions all over the place, but in this post I will show you that you can
  > do it without any single condition except for the validation logic itself.
  > But the rest of the app, including the UI, doesn’t have conditional logic.
  > That’s great, because it significantly reduces the number of mistakes (bugs)
  > you can make. To understand this post, you don’t need any specific knowledge
  > or experience.

* April 2019: [React Native Navigation and
  ClojureScript](https://040code.github.io/2019/04/02/react-native-navigation-and-clojurescript)
  – A beginner’s guide to realizing proper navigation in a React Native
  application using ClojureScript and shadow-cljs]

* February 2019: [Mob Programming](https://040code.github.io/2019/03/15/mob-programming)

  > Last week I was lucky to be able to attend a workshop about “mob
  > programming”, given by Woody Zuill. As somebody who considers himself
  > “agile” (in the original sense of the word) and who is a proponent of
  > extreme programming, I liked it a lot. In this article I’m sharing some of
  > my findings and learnings.
