{:title "About Unfolded"

I decided it's part for my own little place out there. I like to write a blog
post now and then, and I like it to be accessible. I also like it to be
privacy-friendly. No tracking pixels, social network cookies, no paywall, etc.
Just me, you, and the content.

The name "Unfolded" has two sides to it. On the one hand it's about unfolding
things in the sense of explaining them. And on the other hand it's a reference
to the functional programming primitive `unfold`, which is not as famous as
`fold` by a long stretch, but also quite useful and a good example of things
that I might enjoy discussing on this blog.

Please enjoy my articles, and share them if you like them. You'll have to do so
manually, because I won't facilitate all kinds of companies tracking you.
