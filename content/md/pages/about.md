I love software development. Iâ€™m a generalist and I like learning new things all
the time. I particularly enjoy functional programming, because I believe it can
reduce the complexity of code. And also extreme programming, including practices
like pair programming and test-driven design. I also enjoy teaching others about
it, for example at conferences, or using coding dojos.

## About My Blog

I decided it's time for my own place out there. I like to write a blog post now
and then, and I like it to be accessible. I also like it to be privacy-friendly.
No tracking pixels, social network cookies, no paywall, etc. Just me, you, and
the content.

The name "Unfolded" has two sides to it. On the one hand it's about unfolding
things in the sense of explaining them. And on the other hand it's a reference
to the functional programming primitive `unfold`, which is not as famous as
`fold` by a long stretch, but also quite useful and a good example of things
that I might enjoy discussing on this blog.

Please enjoy my articles, and share them if you like them. You'll have to do so
manually, because I won't facilitate all kinds of companies tracking you.
