My Personal Blog
================

My blog is published at https://unfolded.dev.

I feel it's time to have my own personal blog. This repository is it. Please
enjoy and share! To allow you to comment on my posts, I'm using GitHub issues.
One issue per post, where we can have interesting discussions. Also, I always
like feedback. Do you think my articles are bad? Did they help you? Let me
know, preferably including _why_ you find things good or bad. Thanks!

This blog was created using [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org), which is a static
site generator written in Clojure.
